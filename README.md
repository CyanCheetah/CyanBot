# Installation Guide - Visual Studio Code

Next what you will need is Visual Studio Code. Here we are going to use python as well.

First up, head on over to the Visual Studio website and download the latest release. At the time of writing, I am using Version 1.77

[Visual Studio Code Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Follow the directions for Visual Studio Code and then launch Visual Studio Code!

# Installation Guide - Python

We are writing our code in Python, specifically Ver. 3.12. It * *Should'nt* * matter what version python you use, though don't quote me on that.

Here is the link to the python download interface:
[Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Next what you want to do is open up your Command Prompt and make sure you have Python installed by typing

```
python --version
```

And make sure you get a version number out of it. Your output should look something like this:

```
Python 3.11.2
```

Once you made sure that you have Python installed, you are ready for the next step!
